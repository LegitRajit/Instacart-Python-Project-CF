# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project Overview

Inside of this repository is my exploratory analysis on Instacart. The primary objective for this project was to learn the basics of python and apply them to some Instacart datasets provided by Career Foundry.
My goal was to discover insight on customer shopping habits and provide adequate reccomendations.

The repository has multiple folders which I will provide a brief overview:

**01 Project Management:** Contains the Career Foundry Instacart project brief

**03 Scripts:** Contains python scripts of the entire Career Foundry Python module. Some things I did include: data cleaning, data merging, column derivations, and creating visualizations

**04 Analysis/Visualizations:** This folder contains all my visualizations that I created throughout the entire module. 

**05 Sent to Client:** Contains an Excel File that outlines all the steps I took for my primary analysis (cleaning, wrangling, column derivations,etc.) and also some visualizations and reccomendations

_Note: 02 Data Folder (which contains all the data and its respective manipulations) is not included inside of github due to the files being too large_ 

The most important files inside of this repository are A4 Final Report _(under 05 sent to client)_ and 4.10 IC Final Report Analysis _(under 03 Scripts)_ as these files provide the most information on what I did in Python and how I presented my findings for Instacart
